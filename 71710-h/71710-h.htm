<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Once</span> upon a time Three Little Kittens
went out to slide upon the ice.</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat called after them,
“Dot, Tot, Trot, you have forgotten your
mittens.”</p>

<p>They came back pitter, patter, pitter,
patter, as fast as their furry little feet
would carry them.</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh Three Little Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come put on your mittens,”</div>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">and she handed Dot a pair of red mittens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
and Tot a pair of blue mittens, and Trot a
pair of brown mittens, and the Three Little
Kittens went merrily off to skate.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to wear mittens,” said Dot.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to either,” said Tot.</p>

<p>Trot said, “Oh meow, they squeeze my
paws.”</p>

<p>Now, what do you suppose those naughty
little kittens did?</p>

<p>They took off their mittens and left
them on the bank by the ice pond.</p>

<p>They put on their cunning little skates
and began to skate to and fro, to and fro,
and the wind whistled and called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I may freeze your paws and toes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nobody knows—nobody knows.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>
<p>“My long whiskers,” cried Dot, “How
cold it is skating on the ice.”</p>

<p>“By my long tail,” said Tot, “How cold
my paws are.”</p>

<p>Trot said, “We will go back at once to
the bank and get our mittens.”</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens did not know
that Three Little Foxes had crept up on
the bank.</p>

<p>They did not know that the little Foxes
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“See the nice little mittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Left here by the kittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They did not know that the Three Little
Foxes had put on their mittens and
had run away, waving their beautiful tails
behind them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>When the Three Little Kittens got to
the bank and saw that their mittens were
gone, Dot and Tot cried together,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are sad little Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We have lost our new mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Brave little Trot said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are smart little Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll go find our mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Dot and Tot dried their eyes on
their little wee pocket handkerchiefs and
said, “You are so cheerful brother Trot we
will follow where you lead.”</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens looked one
hour and thirty-six minutes for their mittens,
but they could not find them and so
they went sadly homeward.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat stood in the doorway
looking for them.</p>

<p>She cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Go back, go back you naughty Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go back and pick up your nice new mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens hung their
heads and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We put them on the bank to dry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We hope to find them by and by.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“You naughty Kittens” Old Kit-Cat said.</p>

<p>She sent them, without supper, to bed.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens cried, “Meow,
meow, meow. Can’t we have a dish of
milk? Can’t we have a chicken bone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat shook her head, so
the Three Little Kittens went pit-a-pat
pit-a-pat, up stairs to bed.</p>

<p>They were so hungry they kept talking
about good things to eat and that made
them want their supper more and more.</p>

<p>“Fish and bones” said Dot, “Milk and
cream,” said Tot, “Meat and gravy” said
Trot.</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hush, be still, for over the hill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Sandman comes his bag to fill.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this, the Three Little Kittens pulled
the covers high up over their heads, for
they did not want the Sandman to tuck
them in his bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>ALL THIS TIME THREE LITTLE
FOXES WEARING THREE PAIRS OF
MITTENS WERE DANCING MERRILY
IN THE MOONLIGHT.</p>

<p>The Sandman came up over the hill
and peeped in at the window.</p>

<p>He saw the beds where the Three Little
Kittens lay with the covers pulled up
over their heads. He sang softly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh ho, Little Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I saw your lost mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Where? Where? Where?” cried the
Three Little Kittens in one breath uncovering
their heads.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image019" style="max-width: 45.9375em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">THREE LITTLE FOXES WEARING THREE

</figure>
<br>

<p>The Sandman answered in a sing-song-lazy
kind of way,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come jump in the sack,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have on my back.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens were thinking
so hard about their mittens that they forgot
to be afraid and they went whisk!
bound! into the Sandman’s sack and rode
merrily far away over hill and dale, away,
away, away.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Sandman’s sack broke and
out fell the Three Little Kittens.</p>

<p>The Sandman did not notice what had
happened, and he ran on leaving the Three
Little Kittens behind him.</p>

<p>They saw a little wee house in the
woods and ran and knocked on the door.</p>

<p>Old Mother Catastrophe, the oldest Cat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
in the world stuck her head out of the
window and called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Did you happen to have a mishap?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You sadly disturbed me from my nap.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Old Mother Catastrophe, kind and good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are Three Little Kittens lost in the wood.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Catastrophe always knew
what to do, she opened her door and
hugged and kissed the Three Little Kittens
and said to the delight of all, “NOW FOR
THE COOKIE JAR.”</p>

<p>She put a cookie jar on the floor and
the Three Little Kittens put in their three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
little paws without saying “By your leave,
or thank you, or if you please.”</p>

<p>Then what do you suppose happened?</p>

<p>The cookie jar rose in the air and settled
down out of reach, on the highest
shelf in the pantry.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens cried “Oh”
and “Ah” and “What happened to the
cookie jar?”</p>

<p>Old Mother Catastrophe said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>At that, the cookie-jar floated down
again and they ate cookies to their hearts’

<p>They told Old Mother Catastrophe about
their lost mittens but she only shook her

<p>They ran downstairs but Old Mother

<p>There was no fire in the kitchen stove.</p>

<p>Dot and Tot began to cry but brave

<p>Then, to the surprise of all a little
silver bell rang and a voice called,</p>

<p>“I will, I will, I will,” cried the Three
Little Kittens together.</p>

<p>They saw that the wood-box was empty.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens went out and
got wood and filled the box.</p>

<p>They thought they had brought in
enough but a voice called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Day and night, hours four and twenty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Get a plenty, get a plenty.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Little Kittens were so amused they
tumbled over each other and hurried out
to get more wood.</p>

<p>They next heard the tinkle, tinkle,
tinkle, of a silver bell and the voice said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“So far, so good, so far, so good,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the Three Kittens stood there looking
at each other, the same tinkle tinkle
of the same silver bell was heard by them.</p>

<p>“I wonder what that means,” cried Dot
and Tot.</p>

<p>This is what the little silver voice now
said.</p>

<p>Then the Three Little Kittens made a
fire and soon it was roaring merrily.</p>

<p>Then the little bell tinkled again and
a voice said,</p>

<p>“I will, I will, I will,” cried the Three
Little Kittens, and they went out for a pail
of water and filled up the tea-kettle. And
to the surprise of all, there stood Old
Mother Catastrophe in the door way wearing
a cap with silver bells upon it.</p>

<p>She said,</p>

</div>

<p>Dot thought of the empty wood box at
home and Tot remembered that the tea-kettle
was empty.</p>

<p>Trot thought they could help mother
when they got home.</p>

<p>Old Mother Catastrophe hugged and
kissed each Little Kitten in turn and in
less time than it takes to tell it, they sat
down to eat breakfast together.</p>

<p>Old Mother Catastrophe said, “I am
going to see Old Mother Kit-Cat to-day,
and you may keep house while I am gone.”</p>

<p>Then she cried, “Where are my rubbers?
Where is my great-coat? Where is my
market basket? Where is my walking stick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens ran this way
and that way waiting upon her.</p>

<p>She said in parting,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Laugh and play with merry din,</div>

<p>“The FOXES,” said Dot and Tot, “Oh
dear, oh dear we are afraid of the FOXES.”</p>

<p>Trot said, “I am not afraid of the
FOXES, we will not let them in.”</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens stood at the
window waving their pocket handkerchiefs
as Mother Catastrophe went down the walk.</p>

the Three Little Kittens found three little
aprons hanging on a nail and they put
them on and washed and dried the dishes
and put them away.</p>

<p>All day long they danced about merrily
doing nice things for Mother Catastrophe
and the Little Old Man of the Fire shouted
merrily all the time.</p>

<p>Once he shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh Three Little Kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell, where are your mittens?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Our mittens,” cried Dot and Tot, “Oh
dear, oh dear, we had forgotten all about
our mittens.”</p>

<p>At this very minute a very exciting
thing happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Three Little Foxes wearing three pairs
of mittens came dancing down the roadway.</p>

<p>THEY CAME NEARER AND NEARER
EVERY MINUTE.</p>

<p>They ran up to the house and showed
the mittens they were wearing, and they
flattened their noses against the window
pane.</p>

<p>They cried, “Let us in, pray let us in,
we are so cold we are freezing our noses
and toeses.”</p>

<p>I don’t know what in the world would
have happened but the Little Old Man of
the Fire leaped out in his jacket of red
and yellow, crying,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Foxes were so afraid
at that they ran off as fast as their legs
could carry them.</p>

<p>They wore the mittens of course that
belonged to the Kittens.</p>

<p>Dot and Tot began to weep and wail,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh dear, oh dear, we have lost our mittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh dear, oh dear, we are sad little kittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If you guessed one hundred years you
could never guess what brave little Trot
did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>He ran and got the old gold-fish bowl
that stood empty on the table and said,
“Will you cry a bowl full? Will you cry
a pitcher full? Will you cry a tea-kettle
full;—keep it up, keep it up.”</p>

<p>Dot and Tot did not shed another tear
and the Little Old Man of the Fire said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you can count your eyes and nose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis supper time as I suppose.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such a hurrying and scurrying you
never saw as the hands of the kitchen
clock pointed to six.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens had supper on
the table and smoking hot, when Old
Mother Catastrophe came thump, bump,
thump, bump, with her cane, rapping and
tapping, with her cane, all the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>When they told their adventure at supper
time Old Mother Catastrophe said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“First class in Foxes come this way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hear what Catastrophe has to say.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then she said they would have to learn
all about Foxes and go to-morrow to the
foxes’ den and get their lost mittens.</p>

<p>Dot and Tot were so scared at the mention
of Foxes that they crept under the
table but brave little Trot said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dear Mother Catastrophe, old and gray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are not afraid if you’ll lead the way.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Catastrophe rolled her great
green eyes and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis a mile away, alas! alack!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Brave little Trot said, “We will take
you in the wheel-barrow and wheel you
right up to the Foxes’ den if you will only
go with us.”</p>

<p>Mother Catastrophe agreed to this, and
they all sat round in a circle while she
told them about Foxes.</p>

<p>She began by saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

<p>Dot and Tot said, “Oh Mother Catastrophe,
we would rather never find our
mittens than to have to go to the Foxes’
den.”</p>

<p>Trot said, “Please tell us how to find
our lost mittens.”</p>

<p>Mother Catastrophe said, “You go through
the woods by the most crooked path you
can find, and turn to the right, and turn
to the left, to see if the Foxes are behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
you, if all is still you go on until you come

</div>

<p>At that very minute Dot and Tot began
to weep and wail. They cried until little
streams of tears showed on the carpet.</p>

<p>Mother Catastrophe said, “Will they cry
a bucket full? Will they cry a tub full?”</p>

<p>Still Dot and Tot cried, “Boo-hoo, we
do not want to go to the Foxes’ den.”</p>

<p>Trot went out and got the washboiler
and said, “Cry it full so Mother Catastrophe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
can perhaps make use of it.”</p>

<p>But still they cried. While Tot cried
loudly, Dot moved the washboiler so that
none of their tears would fall inside.</p>

<p>“We are afraid of the Foxes, we do not
want to go to their den.”</p>

<p>Old Mother Catastrophe waited for them
to stop crying but they would not stop.</p>

<p>“Must we go to the Foxes’ den?” asked
both Dot and Tot.</p>

<p>“We’ll do whatever Mother Catastrophe
says,” replied Trot.</p>

<p>Then they started to cry again.</p>

<p>Trot brought the washboiler again. “If
you cry hard into this, Mother Catastrophe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
will have soft water to wash her clothes
in.”</p>

<p>Then Dot and Tot began to laugh instead
of cry and Mother Catastrophe said,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“If manners you really want to know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bow politely, and stand in a row.”</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens stood up in
a row and bowed politely.</p>

<p>Old Mother Catastrophe said,</p>

<p>“Dot will make a bow next, and say to
Madam Red Fox, How is your cousin the
Kit-Fox? Has he changed his coat this
season?”</p>

<p>Dot said, “Do Foxes change their coats?
Do tell us about it.”</p>

<p>“Of course they change their coats,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
said Mother Catastrophe. “The Kit-Fox wears
a coat of one color in the summer, and
another color in the winter.</p>

<p>“Tot may next make a bow and say,
How is your cousin the Cross-Fox? He
is not really a very cross Fox but he is
named from his markings.”</p>

<p>“At this very minute little Trot may

<p>“You must thank Madam Red Fox when
she hands you the mittens.”</p>

<p>Trot went out to get the wheel-barrow
for they were going to wheel Mother
Catastrophe to the Foxes’ den.</p>

<p>They helped her into the wheel-barrow
and went through the woods by the most
crooked paths they could find.</p>

<p>Suddenly they all stopped still and Trot
said, “What if Madam Red Fox should not

Little Kittens, “Oh where shall we hide?”</p>

<p>They turned over the wheel-barrow and

</div>

<p>They all took turns in wheeling Mother
Catastrophe home, and then they ran beside
Mother Kit-Cat until they came to
their neat little house at the edge of the
woods.</p>

<p>They said,</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat answered, “What
do you know about Bears? You cannot

    <div class="verse indent0">“Old Mother Kit-Cat we must find our mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mother Kit-Cat looked at the Three
Little Kittens over her spectacles and The
Little Old Man of the Fire said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To interrupt is quite absurd,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Politeness Land, I’ve heard.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens hung their
heads and sat very still in their three little
rocking chairs by the fire.</p>

<p>At this very minute, “Rap-a-tap” was
heard at the door. The door opened, and
in walked Grandpa Growler, the friendliest
Bear in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens cried, “Oh
Grandpa Growler have you some candy for
us? Oh Grandpa Growler have you come
to tell us a story?”</p>

<p>He answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Three Little Kittens all like to tease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, let me get my breath, if you please.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He sat down by the fire and growled
and growled. He was a peculiar Bear and
always growled the loudest when he was
happy. He was very happy now warming
his paws by the cheerful fire.</p>

<p>He was a sure enough Story Teller and
he began in a sing-song kind of way,
“Once upon a time Three Little Kittens
lost their mittens.”</p>
<br>

<p>“How did you know?” asked Dot.</p>

<p>“How did you know?” asked Tot.</p>

<p>Trot said, “Oh Grandpa, please go on
with your story.”</p>

<p>Grandpa Growler growled again pleasantly
and said,</p>

</div>

<p>“Didn’t they really, truly fit?” asked
Dot and Tot.</p>

<p>Trot said as before, “Oh Grandpa, go
on with your story, please.”</p>

<p>At this Grandpa Growler removed his
spectacles and said,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">They traded the mittens for milk and honey.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens joined paws
and whirled round singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Three Little Bears have our mittens ho, ho,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To their little wee house in the woods we must go.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Grandpa Growler was always in a hurry
to do things so he growled again pleasantly
saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will not wait a year and a day,</div>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>
<p>Before the Three Little Kittens could
say a word he had tucked Dot and Tot in
his overcoat pockets, and he tucked Trot
in his market basket and walked off in
his funny flat-footed manner.</p>

<p>The Little Kittens felt safe but Dot and
Tot whispered to each other, “What if we
should fall? What if we should meet the
Bears in the woods?”</p>

<p>They went on and on until they came
to the House of the Three Bears.</p>

<p>They could hear the Bears scolding
about somebody eating their porridge and
sitting in their chairs.</p>

<p>Then he growled as loud as he could,
and the Three Bears stopped their noise.</p>

<p>All would have gone well I am sure, if
the porridge had not smelled so good.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the Three Little Kittens
jumped on the table and began to eat porridge
as fast as they could.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho,” cried the Three Bears, “so we
have more visitors.” They thought the
Three Little Kittens so cute they hugged
them most too hard but Grandpa Growler
said,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>“THE MITTENS!” shouted the Three
Bears in one breath. Then they cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Three Little Foxes are very sly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They brought us the mittens only to try.”</div>

<p>“Didn’t they fit you?” asked Dot.</p>

<p>“Didn’t they fit you?” asked Tot.</p>

<p>“Where can they be now?” asked Trot.</p>

<p>The Three Bears said,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“You dear little Kittens, we gave up the mittens,</div>

</div>

<p>“Squirrels,” said Dot and Tot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“Curly-Tails,” said Trot.</p>

<p>They had a fine visit with the Three
Bears and by and by went merrily homeward
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Grandpa Growler swung a lighted lantern
before them growling softly all the
time.</p>

<p>He was very fond of fish and kept saying
under his breath, “I wish I had some
trout, I wish I had some salmon. I am
so hungry I could eat Three Little Kittens.”</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens were not at
all afraid for this was one of Grandpa
Growler’s jokes.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“FISH” roared Grandpa Growler so
loudly that the roof nearly came off.</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat brought in a dish
of fish for all and Grandpa Growler said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>They soon went merrily to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>All this time Three Little Foxes wearing
three pairs of mittens were dancing
merrily in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire sang,</p>

<p>“You mean squirrels,” said Dot and Tot
sleepily.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire sang
his song, but I don’t know what he knew
about the matter.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE SURPRISE PARTY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Old</span> Mother Kit-Cat sat knitting as
usual one evening and her needles
went “click, click, click,” when “a rap-a-tap”
was heard at the door and in walked
Grandpa Growler saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A surprise party, a surprise party,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here I am alive and hearty.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat’s eyes got as big as
saucers and she said, “I am afraid you let
the Cat out of the Bag that time Grandpa.
Who told you about a surprise party?”</p>

<p>Grandpa Growler replied,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I say such funny things most of the time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whether I’m talking in prose or in rhyme.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He growled so pleasantly at that, that
the Three Little Kittens got the very best
rocking chair for him and the hair-cloth
footstool, and said, “Sit here, grandpa, in
the rocking chair by the fire.”</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat was wondering if
he was really only joking about a surprise
party when “rap-a-tap” was heard on the
door and the Three Little Bears came in.</p>

<p>They cried out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A surprise party we think very good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are the Three Bears that live in the woods.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>
<p>They had no sooner seated themselves
on three little stools by the fire when
“rap-a-tap,” sounded on the door again.</p>

<p>Old Mother Kit-Cat straightened her
cap and called.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come in, come in, the hearth is wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s room for one and all inside.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They all held their breath for no one
came in this time.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens whispered to
each other “What if it should be the Three
Little Foxes coming in next? What if it
should be the Three Little Foxes who stole
our mittens?”</p>

<p>The Three Little Curly-Tails came in
next, with a hop and a skip and a bound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>The next minute there was heard a
great rumbling and tumbling and Grandpa
Growler, who stood with his eyes to the
key-hole said, “Some one is coming in a
wheel-barrow.”</p>

<p>Then the whole company shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh Grandpa Growler, the secret is out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis Mother Catastrophe, without a doubt.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, Old Uncle Mouser was
wheeling Old Mother Catastrophe nearer
and nearer every minute.</p>

<p>He kept saying over and over, “I hope
no one has taken my red plush-lined
basket, I hope no one has taken my red
plush-lined basket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>They came in, and Old Mother Catastrophe
shook the dust off her fur and
whiskers and she said every one looked to
her as big as life and twice as natural.</p>

<p>Then the Ground-Hog came in muttering
about his shadow, but the Beaver sent
a note of regret for he was too shy for
company.</p>

<p>I do not suppose they would have had
a bit to eat for refreshment if The Little
Old Man of the Fire had not been there.</p>

<p>He sang to the Three Little Kittens so
softly that no one else heard,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Coffee, some sugar, and tea will do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make up some cookies and rich pies too.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>
<p>The Three Little Kittens went hurrying
and scurrying into the kitchen.</p>

<p>They ran this way, and that way, cooking
tea and coffee and mixing up cookies
and pies.</p>

<p>The Three Little Foxes wearing three
pairs of mittens danced up to the window
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You cannot cook, for so we’ve heard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Three Little Kittens, ’tis quite absurd.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens were so surprised
that they dropped their three little
spoons into their three little bowls, but
the Little Old Man of the Fire said, quite
as though nothing had happened.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“MOST ANYTHING YOU’LL LEARN TO DO,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">IF YOU WORK TO MAKE THE WISH COME TRUE.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now the Three Little Foxes danced this
way, and that way, and came up again to
the kitchen window.</p>

<p>The Three Little Foxes shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“More sugar, more spice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make everything nice.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They troubled the Three Little Kittens
so they could not think straight to save
their lives.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire suddenly
darted through the open door shouting,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ll burn your bushy-tails ’tis true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come on, I’ll run a race with you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>
<p>The Three Little Foxes could feel the
Old Man’s hot breath and they scampered
off as swiftly as the wind.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I can travel even faster,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’ll bring you a disaster,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take off the mittens, take off the mittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For they belong to Three Little Kittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this, the Three Little Foxes lost no
time you may guess.</p>

<p>They threw the mittens down by the
bank of a river near by.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire shouted,
“Sink or swim, sink or swim,” and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
pushed the Three Little Foxes into the
river and they had to swim all the way
home.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man of the Fire picked
up the mittens and washed them nicely,
then he took them back home and hung
them on the line to dry.</p>

<p>All this time the Three Little Kittens
were baking and stewing, and by and by
they had a regular Surprise Party meal
ready, and all the animals cried, “Hurrah,
hurrah, for the Three Little Kittens.”</p>

<p>After they had eaten everything they
could lay their paws on, Old Uncle Mouser
told stories, and Old Mother Catastrophe
said, as the clock struck ten,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mother Catastrophe, old and gray,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should start out now on the homeward way.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This ended the party, and Old Uncle
Mouser got the wheel-barrow, though he
looked longingly, at the red plush-lined
basket that waited him by the fire.</p>

<p>There was the greatest shaking of paws
you ever saw and Grandpa Growler said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m old and stiff, you may believe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll stay all night now, by your leave.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the guests went home Old Mother
Kit-Cat said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I really believe my dear little kittens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the clothes line I see three pairs of mittens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Three Little Kittens went with a</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>hop and a skip and a bound to get
their mittens and Three Little Foxes came
tagging them, as if they were playing hide-and-seek.</p>

<p>The Three Little Kittens cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are Three Little Kittens who lost our mittens,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And now we will call, Good bye, good bye.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Not so fast,” said Grandpa Growler,
“What will Kit-Cat do with the new mittens

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class='agate'>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</div>

<div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>
<div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>
<div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>
<div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>
<div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>
<div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>
<div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>
<div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div>
<div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>
<div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>
<div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div>
<ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>
<div>
1.F.
</div>
<div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>
<div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>
<div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>
<div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>
<div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>
<div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>
<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div>
<div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>
<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>
<div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>
<div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>
<div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>
<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>
<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
